ABB IRB 140 Robot IRC5 controller Routine code
*****************************MainModule.mod***********************************
Used for the following routine:
Robot picks the dice and throws it on the conveyor in movement. 
Dice is detected and analyzed by C++ application using IP camera, 
that determines its orientation and position in Real-Time. 
All the data is sent to the PC via Ethernet. PC is providing this 
data towards IRC5 controller via Ethernet as well. 
The robot pick up the dice from the conveyor and place it on the table.
The routine is complete when all the dices are placed at each destination. 
If there are any repeated dice detected, the robot picks them up and throws 
them again one by one.
*NOTE:
The following module can be simulated at robotstudio virtual controller.

OPENCV Libraries Implementation for computer vision:
****************************dice_recognition.cpp*****************************
Needs previous configuration using VS2017 or previous version.
You can find how to link your libraries by searching on the internet.
Or at the official OpenCV site following all steps. 
*****************************************************************************
PC-SKD implementation for comunication between PC, and robot controller:
****************************Form1.cs*****************************************
Also it is required to have installed PC-SDK libraries on your PC that 
are available on ABB official site.
Once you have installed this toolkit you will have to link it with yours
VS2017 project. 
*****************************************************************************
PC-SKD implementation for comunication between PC, and robot controller:
****************************Form1.Designer.cs********************************
Used for application window, controls and indicators design 
*****************************************************************************
*NOTE*:
OpenCV libraries are implemented for object detection and 
recognition using IP camera and C++ Application.
PC-SDK is implemented for comunication between C++ Application and 
Robot Controller Routine that runs a MainModule.
