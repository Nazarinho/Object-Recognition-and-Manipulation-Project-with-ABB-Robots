ABB IRB 140 Robot IRC5 controller Routine code
*****************************MainModule.mod***********************************
Used for the following routine:
Robot pick the dice and throw it on the conveyor in movement. 
Dice is detected and analyzed by C++ application using IP camera, 
that determines it's orientation and position. 
All the data is sending to the PC via Ethernet. PC is providing this data 
towards IRC5 controller that makes robot to pick up the dice of the conveyor 
and place it on the table at real time. 
The routine is complete when all dices are placed at each destination. 
If there is repeated dice detected, the robot picks it up and throw it again.
*NOTE:
The following module can be simulated at robotstudio virtual controller.

OPENCV Libraries Implementation for computer vision:
****************************dice_recognition.cpp*****************************
Needs previous configuration using VS2017 or previous version.
You can find how to link your libraries searching on the internet.
Or at official OPENCV site following all steps. 
*****************************************************************************

PC-SKD implementation for comunication between PC, and robot controller:
****************************Form1.cs*****************************************
Also is required to have installed PC-SDK libraries on your PC that 
are available on ABB official site.
Once you have installed this tool kit you will have to link it with yours
VS2017 project.

PC-SKD implementation for comunication between PC, and robot controller:
****************************Form1.Designer.cs********************************
Used for application window, controls and indicators design 
*****************************************************************************

*NOTE*:
OPENCV libraries are implemented for object detecting and 
recognition using IP camera and C++ Application.
PC-SDK is implemented for comunication between C++ Aplication and Robot
Controller Routine that runs a MainModule RAPID code.
