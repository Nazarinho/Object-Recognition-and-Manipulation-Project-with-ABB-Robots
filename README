*****************************MainModule.mod***********************************
ABB IRB 140 Robot IRC5 controller Routine code.
Used for the following routine:
The Robot picks the dice and throws it on the conveyor in movement. 
Dice is detected and analyzed by C++ application using IP camera, 
that determines its orientation and position in Real-Time. 
All the data is sent to the PC via Ethernet. PC is providing this 
data towards IRC5 controller via Ethernet as well. 
The robot picks up the dice from the conveyor and place them on the table.
The routine is complete when all the dices are placed at each destination. 
If there are any repeated dice detected, the robot picks them up and throws 
them again one by one.
*NOTE:
The following module can be simulated  the robotstudio virtual env.

OPENCV Libraries Implementation for computer vision:
Needs previous configuration using VS2017 or previous version.
You can find how to link your libraries at the official OpenCV site following 
the tutorial. 

****************************Form1.cs*****************************************
GUI with PC-SKD implementation for comunication between PC, and robot 
controller. It requires to have installed PC-SDK libraries on your PC that 
are available on ABB official site.
Once you have installed this toolkit you will have to link it with your
VS2017 project. 

*NOTE*:
OpenCV libraries are implemented for object detection and 
recognition in real-time using IP camera and C++ Application.
PC-SDK is implemented for comunication between C++ Application and 
Robot Controller Routine that runs a MainModule in real-time.
